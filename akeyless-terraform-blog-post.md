## Two Integration Angles

### Angle 1: Managing Akeyless with Terraform
**Use Case**: Infrastructure as Code for secrets management configuration

#### What We'll Demonstrate:
- Using the Akeyless Terraform Provider to:
  - Configure authentication methods
  - Create and manage static secrets
  - Set up dynamic secret engines (AWS, Azure, GCP, databases)
  - Manage access roles and policies
  - Configure secret rotation policies

#### Demo Scenario - Part 1: Configure Akeyless Infrastructure
```hcl
# Part 1: Akeyless Setup - Authentication, Roles, and Database Secrets
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.6"
  required_providers {
    akeyless = {
      source  = "akeyless-community/akeyless"
      version = ">= 1.10.0"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.1"
    }
  }
}

# Configure Akeyless provider
provider "akeyless" {
  api_gateway_address = var.akeyless_gateway_address
  api_key_login {
    access_id  = var.akeyless_access_id
    access_key = var.akeyless_access_key
  }
}

# Create API Key authentication method
resource "akeyless_auth_method_api_key" "terraform_auth" {
  name = "/terraform-demo/auth-method"
}

# Create access role
resource "akeyless_role" "terraform_role" {
  name = "/terraform-demo/role"
  assoc_auth_method = [akeyless_auth_method_api_key.terraform_auth.name]
}

# Generate secure database password
resource "random_password" "db_password" {
  length  = 16
  special = true
  upper   = true
  lower   = true
  numeric = true
}

# Create static secret for database password
resource "akeyless_static_secret" "db_password" {
  path  = "/terraform-demo/static/db-password"
  value = random_password.db_password.result
}

# Create static secret for database configuration
resource "akeyless_static_secret" "db_config" {
  path = "/terraform-demo/static/db-config"
  value = jsonencode({
    table_name = "terraform-demo-table"
    hash_key   = "id"
    attributes = [
      {
        name = "id"
        type = "S"
      }
    ]
    billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
    tags = {
      Environment = "Demo"
      CreatedBy   = "Terraform"
      SecretSource = "Akeyless"
    }
  })
}

# Create static secret for external API key
resource "akeyless_static_secret" "external_api_key" {
  path  = "/terraform-demo/static/api-key"
  value = "external-service-api-key-${random_password.api_suffix.result}"
}

resource "random_password" "api_suffix" {
  length  = 8
  special = false
  upper   = false
}

# Associate role with secrets for read access
resource "akeyless_role_rule" "static_access" {
  role_name = akeyless_role.terraform_role.name
  path      = "/terraform-demo/static/*"
  capability = ["read"]
}
```

### Angle 2: Using Akeyless Secrets in Terraform
**Use Case**: Securely consuming secrets during Terraform operations

#### What We'll Demonstrate:
- Retrieving database secrets and configuration from Akeyless
- Using retrieved secrets to provision and configure DynamoDB infrastructure
- Runtime secret retrieval with zero secrets exposure in Terraform configuration
- Best practices for handling secrets in Terraform state files

#### Demo Scenario - Part 2: Retrieve Secrets and Deploy Database Infrastructure
```hcl
# Part 2: Database Infrastructure Deployment using Akeyless secrets
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.6"
  required_providers {
    akeyless = {
      source  = "akeyless-community/akeyless"
      version = ">= 1.10.0"
    }
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.1"
    }
  }
}

# Configure Akeyless provider for secret retrieval
provider "akeyless" {
  api_gateway_address = var.akeyless_gateway_address
  api_key_login {
    access_id  = var.akeyless_access_id
    access_key = var.akeyless_access_key
  }
}

# Retrieve database secrets from Akeyless
data "akeyless_secret" "external_api_key" {
  path = "/terraform-demo/static/api-key"
}

data "akeyless_secret" "db_password" {
  path = "/terraform-demo/static/db-password"
}

data "akeyless_secret" "db_config" {
  path = "/terraform-demo/static/db-config"
}

# Parse the database configuration JSON retrieved from Akeyless
locals {
  db_config = jsondecode(data.akeyless_secret.db_config.value)
  api_key_masked = "${substr(data.akeyless_secret.external_api_key.value, 0, 10)}..."
}

# Configure AWS provider using variables
provider "aws" {
  region     = var.aws_region
  access_key = var.aws_access_key_id
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_access_key
}

# Create DynamoDB table using configuration retrieved from Akeyless
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "demo_table" {
  name         = local.db_config.table_name
  billing_mode = local.db_config.billing_mode
  hash_key     = local.db_config.hash_key

  dynamic "attribute" {
    for_each = local.db_config.attributes
    content {
      name = attribute.value.name
      type = attribute.value.type
    }
  }

  tags = merge(
    local.db_config.tags,
    {
      ExternalAPIKey = local.api_key_masked
      SecretSource   = "Akeyless"
      PasswordSource = "Retrieved from Akeyless"
    }
  )
}

# Add sample data to demonstrate the database is working
resource "aws_dynamodb_table_item" "demo_items" {
  count      = 3
  table_name = aws_dynamodb_table.demo_table.name
  hash_key   = aws_dynamodb_table.demo_table.hash_key

  item = jsonencode({
    id = {
      S = "demo-item-${count.index + 1}"
    }
    timestamp = {
      N = tostring(1672531200 + count.index)
    }
    message = {
      S = "Demo item ${count.index + 1} created using credentials retrieved from Akeyless"
    }
    api_key_source = {
      S = "Retrieved from ${data.akeyless_secret.external_api_key.path}"
    }
    db_credential_source = {
      S = "Retrieved from ${data.akeyless_secret.db_password.path}"
    }
    security_note = {
      S = "All credentials fetched at runtime - zero secrets exposure in configuration"
    }
  })
}

# Output information about the deployed database
output "dynamodb_table_name" {
  value     = aws_dynamodb_table.demo_table.name
  sensitive = true
}

output "dynamodb_table_arn" {
  value = aws_dynamodb_table.demo_table.arn
}

output "demo_items_count" {
  value = length(aws_dynamodb_table_item.demo_items)
}

output "secrets_used" {
  value = {
    external_api_key = data.akeyless_secret.external_api_key.path
    database_config  = data.akeyless_secret.db_config.path
    database_password = data.akeyless_secret.db_password.path
  }
  sensitive = true
}
```

**⚠️ Important Security Note**: While this demo shows how to retrieve secrets in Terraform, be aware that secret values retrieved via data sources are stored in the Terraform state file. Always ensure your state files are properly secured with encryption at rest and access controls. 

**Future Security Enhancements**: Terraform 1.10+ introduces ephemeral resources and 1.11+ adds write-only attributes that eliminate secrets from state files entirely. While the Akeyless provider doesn't yet support these features, they represent the future of secure Terraform secrets management where sensitive values never persist in state.

## Real-World Demo: Database Infrastructure with Secure Secrets

Our demonstration showcases a practical two-part workflow that DevOps teams can implement immediately:

### Part 1: Akeyless Infrastructure Setup (5-7 minutes)
We use Terraform to configure our entire secrets management infrastructure, creating authentication methods, access roles, and securely storing database credentials and configuration. This Infrastructure as Code approach ensures reproducible, version-controlled secrets management.

### Part 2: Secure Database Deployment (6-8 minutes)
We retrieve database secrets and configuration from Akeyless at runtime, then use these credentials to provision a DynamoDB table with sample data. This demonstrates how sensitive information flows securely through your infrastructure without ever being exposed in configuration files.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is Akeyless and how does it work with Terraform?

Akeyless is a zero-trust secrets management platform that integrates natively with Terraform through a comprehensive provider. Unlike traditional solutions, Akeyless uses fragment-based architecture where secrets never exist in complete form anywhere, providing superior security for your infrastructure automation.

### How is Akeyless different from HashiCorp Vault with Terraform?

Akeyless offers several key advantages: SaaS-first with no infrastructure to manage, fragment-based security model, native cloud integrations, and a purpose-built Terraform provider with 30+ resources. While Vault requires complex clustering and operational overhead, Akeyless provides enterprise-grade security with minimal maintenance.

### Can I use Akeyless secrets in Terraform without storing them in state files?

While current Terraform versions store retrieved secrets in state files, you can minimize exposure through proper state encryption and access controls. Terraform 1.10+ introduces ephemeral resources and 1.11+ adds write-only attributes that will eliminate secrets from state entirely - features we're working to support in future provider releases.

### What types of secrets can Akeyless manage for Terraform workflows?

Akeyless supports static secrets (API keys, passwords, certificates), dynamic secrets (AWS/Azure/GCP credentials, database users), and configuration data. Our demo shows database password management, but you can also manage cloud credentials, SSH keys, TLS certificates, and application configurations.

### How secure is Akeyless compared to traditional secrets management?

Akeyless uses fragment-based architecture where secrets are distributed across multiple secure locations and never stored complete anywhere. This zero-trust approach eliminates single points of failure and provides stronger security than encrypted storage solutions.

### Can I migrate from HashiCorp Vault to Akeyless?

Yes, we provide migration tools and professional services to help transition from Vault and other platforms. The migration typically involves mapping your existing secret paths and access policies to Akeyless, then updating your Terraform configurations to use the Akeyless provider.

### Does Akeyless support multi-cloud Terraform deployments?

Absolutely. Akeyless is built for multi-cloud environments with native integrations for AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes. You can manage secrets consistently across all platforms through a single interface and Terraform provider.

### What are the costs associated with using Akeyless?

Akeyless offers predictable subscription pricing based on usage, with no infrastructure costs since it's SaaS-first. Unlike self-hosted solutions, you don't need to provision servers, manage clustering, or handle operational overhead, often resulting in lower total cost of ownership.

### How do I handle secret rotation with Akeyless and Terraform?

Akeyless provides automatic rotation for dynamic secrets (cloud credentials, database users) and supports rotation policies for static secrets. The Terraform provider automatically handles credential refresh, ensuring your infrastructure always uses valid credentials.

### Can I use Akeyless in air-gapped or on-premises environments?

Yes, Akeyless offers on-premises gateways that can operate in air-gapped environments while still benefiting from the SaaS control plane. This hybrid approach provides maximum flexibility for organizations with strict security requirements.

### What compliance standards does Akeyless meet?

Akeyless is SOC 2 Type 2, FIPS 140-2, and Common Criteria certified, with support for various compliance frameworks including PCI DSS, HIPAA, and FedRAMP. The zero-trust architecture helps organizations meet strict regulatory requirements.

### How does Akeyless handle high availability and disaster recovery?

The SaaS platform provides built-in high availability across multiple regions. For on-premises deployments, gateways can be clustered for redundancy. The fragment-based architecture ensures that no single component failure can compromise your secrets.
