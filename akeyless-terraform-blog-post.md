# Akeyless + Terraform: Managing Secrets in Cloud Infrastructure

## Executive Summary

If you're a Terraform user, you've likely heard of, or are already using, HashiCorp Vault for managing secrets. It's the default choice for many DevOps teams. But what if there was a more cloud-native, operationally simpler way to achieve powerful secrets management directly in your terraform configuration? This blog post demonstrates that Akeyless isn't just an alternative to traditional secret management tools, it's a better fit for modern infrastructure as code workflows.

We'll prove it by showing how to securely store secrets, manage sensitive information, and protect against data breaches using static secrets that flow seamlessly through your cloud infrastructure without complex backend configuration or clustering requirements.

## Target Audience
- DevOps Engineers managing cloud resources and terraform code
- Security Engineers focused on secrets management and access control
- Terraform Users currently using HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- Organizations seeking advanced secret management tools with role based access control
- Teams looking to encrypt sensitive data and prevent security breaches

## Key Points: Why Akeyless Outperforms Traditional Secret Management Tools

### Managing Secrets with Zero-Trust Architecture vs HashiCorp Vault
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Akeyless provides secrets management without storing complete secrets, unlike traditional solutions
- **Cloud-Native Design**: Purpose-built for modern cloud resources and environment variables management
- **Simplified Operations**: No complex infrastructure to manage compared to HashiCorp Vault clustering requirements
- **Enhanced Security**: Distributed fragments approach eliminates single points of failure and security breaches
- **Infrastructure as Code Support**: Native Terraform integration with role based access control and secret rotation capabilities

## Two Integration Angles

### Angle 1: Managing Akeyless as Code
**Use Case**: Using infrastructure as code to configure your secret management tools

#### What We'll Demonstrate with Terraform Configuration:
- Configure authentication methods with role based access control using the Akeyless Terraform Provider
- Create and manage static secrets including API keys and database credentials  
- Implement access control policies with least privilege principle
- Store configuration data as key value pairs for infrastructure deployment
- Establish secure secrets management without complex vault provider clustering

#### Demo Scenario Part 1: Terraform Configuration for Managing Secrets Infrastructure

Setting up the foundation with proper terraform configuration and handling secrets securely:
**Step 1: Provider Configuration Block**

First, we configure the required providers for managing secrets with infrastructure as code:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.6"
  required_providers {
    akeyless = {
      source  = "akeyless-community/akeyless"
      version = ">= 1.10.0"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.1"
    }
  }
}
```

The terraform config block establishes version requirements ensuring compatibility with advanced features for managing sensitive data.

**Step 2: Secure Provider Authentication**

Next, we configure the Akeyless provider without hardcoding sensitive values in code repositories:

```hcl
provider "akeyless" {
  api_gateway_address = var.akeyless_gateway_address
  api_key_login {
    access_id  = var.akeyless_access_id
    access_key = var.akeyless_access_key
  }
}
```

This configuration block uses environment variables to handle secrets authentication, preventing secrets stored in version control systems.

**Step 3: Role Based Access Control Implementation**

Now we establish secure access control for managing secrets with the least privilege principle:

```hcl
resource "akeyless_auth_method_api_key" "terraform_auth" {
  name = "/terraform-demo/auth-method"
}

resource "akeyless_role" "terraform_role" {
  name = "/terraform-demo/role"
  assoc_auth_method = [akeyless_auth_method_api_key.terraform_auth.name]
}
```

This implements role based access control, ensuring only authorized terraform code can access secrets.

**Step 4: Secure Database Credentials Creation**

Here we generate and store database credentials using best practices for handling secrets:

```hcl
resource "random_password" "db_password" {
  length  = 16
  special = true
  upper   = true
  lower   = true
  numeric = true
}

resource "akeyless_static_secret" "db_password" {
  path  = "/terraform-demo/static/db-password"
  value = random_password.db_password.result
}
```

This approach generates secure passwords that include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters while storing secrets in a centralized secret management tool.

**Step 5: API Keys and Configuration Management**

Finally, we create additional secrets including API keys and configuration data using key value pairs:

```hcl
resource "akeyless_static_secret" "db_config" {
  path = "/terraform-demo/static/db-config"
  value = jsonencode({
    table_name = "terraform-demo-table"
    hash_key   = "id"
    attributes = [
      {
        name = "id"
        type = "S"
      }
    ]
    billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
    tags = {
      Environment = "Demo"
      CreatedBy   = "Terraform"
      SecretSource = "Akeyless"
    }
  })
}

resource "random_password" "api_suffix" {
  length  = 8
  special = false
  upper   = false
}

resource "akeyless_static_secret" "external_api_key" {
  path  = "/terraform-demo/static/api-key"
  value = "external-service-api-key-${random_password.api_suffix.result}"
}
```

This demonstrates storing sensitive values including API keys and complex configuration as JSON, ensuring sensitive information remains protected.

**Step 6: Access Control Rules**

```hcl
resource "akeyless_role_rule" "static_access" {
  role_name = akeyless_role.terraform_role.name
  path      = "/terraform-demo/static/*"
  capability = ["read"]
}
```

This completes our access control setup, applying the least privilege principle to ensure only authorized access to our secrets secure storage.

### Angle 2: Using Akeyless Secrets to Build Infrastructure  
**Use Case**: Leveraging secret management tools for secure cloud services deployment

#### What We'll Demonstrate for Static Secret Management:
- Reading static secrets from Akeyless instead of AWS Secrets Manager during terraform apply
- Using retrieved secret values and configuration data to provision cloud infrastructure  
- Runtime secret retrieval ensuring zero secrets exposure in terraform configuration files
- Best practices for managing sensitive information including database credentials and API keys

#### Demo Scenario Part 2: Terraform Secrets Retrieval and AWS Infrastructure Deployment
This section demonstrates how to read secrets from your secret management tools and use them with cloud resources.

**Step 1: Multi-Provider Configuration for Cloud Infrastructure**

We configure both the AWS provider and Akeyless for managing cloud resources with encrypted sensitive data:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.6"
  required_providers {
    akeyless = {
      source  = "akeyless-community/akeyless"
      version = ">= 1.10.0"
    }
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "akeyless" {
  api_gateway_address = var.akeyless_gateway_address
  api_key_login {
    access_id  = var.akeyless_access_id
    access_key = var.akeyless_access_key
  }
}
```

This multi-cloud setup allows us to handle secrets while deploying to AWS, avoiding hardcoded values in our terraform code.

**Step 2: Retrieving Secret Values at Runtime**

Here we demonstrate how to read secrets without exposing sensitive values in our terraform configuration:

```hcl
data "akeyless_secret" "external_api_key" {
  path = "/terraform-demo/static/api-key"
}

data "akeyless_secret" "db_password" {
  path = "/terraform-demo/static/db-password"
}

data "akeyless_secret" "db_config" {
  path = "/terraform-demo/static/db-config"
}
```

These data sources retrieve secret values at runtime, ensuring sensitive information is never hardcoded in code repositories while providing a superior alternative to AWS Secrets Manager waits and complex default value configurations.

**Step 3: Processing Retrieved Secret Values and AWS Provider Configuration**

We parse the retrieved configuration and set up our cloud provider authentication using environment variables:

```hcl
locals {
  db_config = jsondecode(data.akeyless_secret.db_config.value)
  api_key_masked = "${substr(data.akeyless_secret.external_api_key.value, 0, 10)}..."
}

provider "aws" {
  region     = var.aws_region
  access_key = var.aws_access_key_id
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_access_key
}
```

The local values allow us to work with complex secret data while the AWS provider uses separate environment variables for cloud authentication, maintaining separation between secrets management and cloud provider credentials.

**Step 4: AWS Infrastructure Deployment Using Retrieved Secrets**

Now we deploy cloud resources using the configuration and credentials retrieved from our secret management tool:

```hcl
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "demo_table" {
  name         = local.db_config.table_name
  billing_mode = local.db_config.billing_mode
  hash_key     = local.db_config.hash_key

  dynamic "attribute" {
    for_each = local.db_config.attributes
    content {
      name = attribute.value.name
      type = attribute.value.type
    }
  }

  tags = merge(
    local.db_config.tags,
    {
      ExternalAPIKey = local.api_key_masked
      SecretSource   = "Akeyless"
      PasswordSource = "Retrieved from Akeyless"
    }
  )
}
```

This demonstrates deploying AWS cloud infrastructure while keeping all sensitive information securely managed outside of our terraform code and state file considerations.

**Step 5: Database Population with Audit Trail**

Finally, we populate the database with sample data that demonstrates our secure secrets workflow:

```hcl
resource "aws_dynamodb_table_item" "demo_items" {
  count      = 3
  table_name = aws_dynamodb_table.demo_table.name
  hash_key   = aws_dynamodb_table.demo_table.hash_key

  item = jsonencode({
    id = {
      S = "demo-item-${count.index + 1}"
    }
    timestamp = {
      N = tostring(1672531200 + count.index)
    }
    message = {
      S = "Demo item ${count.index + 1} created using credentials retrieved from Akeyless"
    }
    api_key_source = {
      S = "Retrieved from ${data.akeyless_secret.external_api_key.path}"
    }
    db_credential_source = {
      S = "Retrieved from ${data.akeyless_secret.db_password.path}"
    }
    security_note = {
      S = "All credentials fetched at runtime, zero secrets exposure in configuration"
    }
  })
}
```

This creates database items with full audit trails showing how secret values were retrieved, demonstrating complete transparency in our secrets management workflow.

**Step 6: Secure Output Values**

The final step provides outputs while maintaining security best practices:

```hcl
output "dynamodb_table_name" {
  value     = aws_dynamodb_table.demo_table.name
  sensitive = true
}

output "dynamodb_table_arn" {
  value = aws_dynamodb_table.demo_table.arn
}

output "demo_items_count" {
  value = length(aws_dynamodb_table_item.demo_items)
}

output "secrets_used" {
  value = {
    external_api_key = data.akeyless_secret.external_api_key.path
    database_config  = data.akeyless_secret.db_config.path
    database_password = data.akeyless_secret.db_password.path
  }
  sensitive = true
}
```

Notice how outputs containing sensitive values are marked appropriately, ensuring the state file handles secrets securely while providing visibility into which secret paths were used.

## Akeyless vs HashiCorp Vault: A Practical Comparison

Let's examine the real operational differences between Akeyless and HashiCorp Vault for terraform secrets management:

| Feature | Akeyless | HashiCorp Vault (Self-Hosted) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Backend Setup** | SaaS (Zero setup) | Manage Raft/Consul storage, backups |
| **High Availability** | Built-in across regions | Manual clustering, load balancing |
| **Unsealing** | Not required | Manual or auto-unseal configuration |
| **Terraform Code Complexity** | Simple `akeyless_static_secret` resources | Multiple `vault_generic_secret` + mount configs |
| **Infrastructure Overhead** | None, fully managed | Servers, networking, storage management |
| **Access Control** | Built-in role based access control | Complex policy language and auth methods |
| **Secret Rotation** | Automated with configurable policies | Manual configuration of rotation workflows |

### Code Comparison: Creating Static Secrets

**Akeyless Terraform Configuration:**
```hcl
resource "akeyless_static_secret" "db_password" {
  path  = "/app/db-password"
  value = var.secure_password
}

resource "akeyless_role_rule" "app_access" {
  role_name  = akeyless_role.app_role.name
  path       = "/app/*"
  capability = ["read"]
}
```

**HashiCorp Vault Terraform Configuration:**
```hcl
resource "vault_mount" "kvv2" {
  path = "secret"
  type = "kv"
  options = { version = "2" }
}

resource "vault_generic_secret" "db_password" {
  path = "secret/app/db-password"
  data_json = jsonencode({
    password = var.secure_password
  })
  depends_on = [vault_mount.kvv2]
}

resource "vault_policy" "app_policy" {
  name = "app-policy"
  policy = <<EOT
path "secret/data/app/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOT
}
```

The difference is clear: Akeyless requires significantly less configuration and no infrastructure management overhead.

**⚠️ Important Security Note for State File Management**: While this demo shows how to retrieve secret values in Terraform, be aware that retrieved secrets are stored in the terraform configuration state file. Always ensure your state files are properly secured with encryption at rest and access control, preventing data breaches from exposed state files. Consider using backend configuration with encryption keys and AWS KMS key integration for additional protection.

**Future Security Enhancements**: Terraform 1.10+ introduces ephemeral resources and 1.11+ adds write-only attributes that eliminate secrets from state files entirely. While the Akeyless provider doesn't yet support these advanced features, they represent the future of secure terraform secrets management where sensitive values never persist in state, providing better protection than traditional secrets manager defaults.

## Real-World Demo: Cloud Infrastructure with Terraform Secrets Management

Our demonstration showcases a practical two-part workflow for managing sensitive data that DevOps teams can implement immediately to prevent security breaches:

### Part 1: Infrastructure as Code for Static Secret Management (5-7 minutes)
We use terraform code to configure our entire secrets management infrastructure, creating authentication methods with role based access control, and securely storing static secrets including database credentials, API keys, and configuration data. This infrastructure as code approach ensures reproducible, version-controlled secrets management while maintaining compliance with version control systems best practices.

### Part 2: Secure Cloud Resources Deployment Using Static Secrets (6-8 minutes)  
We read static secrets and configuration data from our secret management tools at runtime, then use this information to provision AWS cloud resources including DynamoDB tables with sample data. This demonstrates how sensitive information flows securely through your cloud infrastructure without ever being exposed in terraform configuration files or code repositories, providing superior protection against data breaches.
