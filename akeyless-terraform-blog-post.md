# Akeyless + Terraform: A Powerful Security-First Infrastructure Combination

## Executive Summary

This blog post and demo will showcase how Akeyless integrates seamlessly with Terraform, providing a superior alternative to HashiCorp Vault + Terraform workflows. We'll demonstrate two key integration patterns that make Akeyless the ideal secrets management solution for Terraform-driven infrastructure.

## Target Audience
- DevOps Engineers and Infrastructure Teams
- Security Engineers 
- Terraform Users currently using HashiCorp Vault
- Organizations looking for zero-trust secrets management

## Key Messaging Points

### Why Akeyless + Terraform Works So Well
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Akeyless provides secrets management without storing complete secrets
- **Cloud-Native**: Purpose-built for modern cloud infrastructure
- **Simplified Operations**: Minimal infrastructure to manage or maintain
- **Enhanced Security**: Distributed fragments approach with no single point of failure
- **Native Terraform Integration**: Purpose-built provider with comprehensive resource support

## Two Integration Angles

### Angle 1: Managing Akeyless with Terraform
**Use Case**: Infrastructure as Code for secrets management configuration

#### What We'll Demonstrate:
- Using the Akeyless Terraform Provider to:
  - Configure authentication methods
  - Create and manage static secrets
  - Set up dynamic secret engines (AWS, Azure, GCP, databases)
  - Manage access roles and policies
  - Configure secret rotation policies

#### Demo Scenario - Part 1: Configure Akeyless Infrastructure
```hcl
# Configure Akeyless provider (v1.10.2+)
terraform {
  required_providers {
    akeyless = {
      source  = "akeyless-community/akeyless"
      version = ">= 1.10.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "akeyless" {
  api_gateway_address = "https://api.akeyless.io"
  aws_iam_login {
    access_id = "YOUR_AWS_IAM_ACCESS_ID"
  }
}

# Create API Key authentication method
resource "akeyless_auth_method_api_key" "terraform_auth" {
  name = "/terraform-demo/auth-method"
}

# Create access role
resource "akeyless_role" "terraform_role" {
  name = "/terraform-demo/role"
  assoc_auth_method = [akeyless_auth_method_api_key.terraform_auth.name]
}

# Create static secret (API key for external service)
resource "akeyless_static_secret" "external_api_key" {
  path  = "/terraform-demo/static/api-key"
  value = "external-service-api-key-${random_password.api_suffix.result}"
}

resource "random_password" "api_suffix" {
  length = 8
  special = false
}

# Create AWS target for dynamic secrets
resource "akeyless_target_aws" "aws_target" {
  name               = "/terraform-demo/targets/aws"
  access_key_id      = var.aws_access_key_id
  access_key         = var.aws_secret_access_key
  region             = var.aws_region
}

# Create AWS dynamic secrets producer
resource "akeyless_producer_aws" "aws_dynamic" {
  name          = "/terraform-demo/dynamic/aws-creds"
  target_name   = akeyless_target_aws.aws_target.name
  access_mode   = "iam_user"
  user_ttl      = "1h"
}

# Associate role with secrets
resource "akeyless_role_rule" "static_access" {
  role_name = akeyless_role.terraform_role.name
  path      = "/terraform-demo/static/*"
  capability = ["read"]
}

resource "akeyless_role_rule" "dynamic_access" {
  role_name = akeyless_role.terraform_role.name
  path      = "/terraform-demo/dynamic/*"
  capability = ["read"]
}
```

### Angle 2: Using Akeyless Secrets in Terraform
**Use Case**: Securely consuming secrets during Terraform operations

#### What We'll Demonstrate:
- Retrieving static secrets from Akeyless for application configuration
- Using dynamic AWS credentials from Akeyless to provision infrastructure
- Best practices for handling secrets in Terraform state files

#### Demo Scenario - Part 2: Retrieve Secrets and Build Infrastructure
```hcl
# Configure providers - we'll use the secrets from Akeyless to authenticate
terraform {
  required_providers {
    akeyless = {
      source  = "akeyless-community/akeyless"
      version = ">= 1.10.0"
    }
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure Akeyless provider for secret retrieval
provider "akeyless" {
  api_gateway_address = "https://api.akeyless.io"
  api_key_login {
    access_id  = var.akeyless_access_id
    access_key = var.akeyless_access_key
  }
}

# Retrieve static secret (external API key)
data "akeyless_secret" "external_api_key" {
  path = "/terraform-demo/static/api-key"
}

# Retrieve dynamic AWS credentials
data "akeyless_dynamic_secret" "aws_creds" {
  name = "/terraform-demo/dynamic/aws-creds"
}

# Configure AWS provider using dynamic credentials from Akeyless
provider "aws" {
  region     = var.aws_region
  access_key = data.akeyless_dynamic_secret.aws_creds.access_key_id
  secret_key = data.akeyless_dynamic_secret.aws_creds.secret_access_key
}

# Generate random suffix for unique bucket names
resource "random_id" "bucket_suffix" {
  byte_length = 4
}

# Create S3 bucket using dynamic AWS credentials
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "demo_bucket" {
  bucket = "akeyless-terraform-demo-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Akeyless Terraform Demo"
    Environment = "Demo"
    CreatedWith = "DynamicCredentials"
    ExternalAPI = data.akeyless_secret.external_api_key.value
  }
}

# Configure bucket versioning
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "demo_versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.demo_bucket.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

# Configure bucket encryption
resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "demo_encryption" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.demo_bucket.id

  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"
    }
  }
}

# Output the bucket name and show we can use the static secret
output "s3_bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.demo_bucket.bucket
}

output "external_api_configured" {
  value = "External API key configured: ${substr(data.akeyless_secret.external_api_key.value, 0, 10)}..."
  sensitive = true
}
```

**⚠️ Important Security Note**: While this demo shows how to retrieve secrets in Terraform, be aware that secret values retrieved via data sources are stored in the Terraform state file. Always ensure your state files are properly secured with encryption at rest and access controls. 

**Future Security Enhancements**: Terraform 1.10+ introduces ephemeral resources and 1.11+ adds write-only attributes that eliminate secrets from state files entirely. While the Akeyless provider doesn't yet support these features, they represent the future of secure Terraform secrets management where sensitive values never persist in state.
