# Example terraform.tfvars file for Part 2: Infrastructure Deployment
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and fill in your actual values

# Akeyless Configuration
akeyless_gateway_address = "https://api.akeyless.io"  # or your custom gateway

# Akeyless API Key Authentication
# These credentials should be generated from the API Key authentication method created in Part 1
akeyless_access_id  = "your-akeyless-access-id"     # From the auth method created in Part 1
akeyless_access_key = "your-akeyless-access-key"    # Generated access key

# AWS Configuration
aws_region = "us-east-1"  # Should match the region used in Part 1

# Notes:
# - The akeyless_access_id and akeyless_access_key are different from Part 1
# - In Part 1, we used AWS IAM authentication to CREATE the Akeyless infrastructure
# - In Part 2, we use API Key authentication to RETRIEVE secrets from Akeyless
# - Ensure the role created in Part 1 has proper permissions to access the secrets
