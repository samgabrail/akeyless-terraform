# Example terraform.tfvars file for Part 1: Akeyless Setup
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and fill in your actual values

# Akeyless Configuration
akeyless_gateway_address = "https://api.akeyless.io"  # or your custom gateway
aws_iam_access_id       = "your-aws-iam-access-id-from-akeyless"

# AWS Credentials for Target Creation
aws_access_key_id     = "AKIA..."  # AWS Access Key with appropriate permissions
aws_secret_access_key = "your-secret-key"
aws_region           = "us-west-2"

# Notes:
# - aws_iam_access_id: This is the Access ID from your Akeyless AWS IAM authentication method
# - aws_access_key_id/aws_secret_access_key: These are used to create the AWS target in Akeyless
#   The target will use these credentials to generate dynamic AWS credentials
# - Ensure your AWS credentials have permissions to create IAM users (for dynamic secrets)
